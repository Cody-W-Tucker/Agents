**Overall Goal:** The agent should identify target personas, research their pain points, and analyze competitors.

**1. Agent Definitions:**

*   **User Proxy Agent (The Orchestrator):**
    *   Name: "Market\_Research\_Manager"
    *   System Message: "You are a market research manager responsible for coordinating research tasks and presenting findings."
    *   Responsibilities:
        *   Assign tasks to other agents.
        *   Review and synthesize research findings.
        *   Present a final report.
        *   Handle user interaction and feedback.
*   **Persona Research Agent:**
    *   Name: "Persona\_Researcher"
    *   System Message: "You are an expert in identifying target personas and gathering information about their demographics, behaviors, and needs."
    *   Responsibilities:
        *   Identify potential target personas based on the consultant's skills.
        *   Find online communities (forums, social media groups, blogs) where these personas hang out.
        *   Gather information about their roles, responsibilities, and goals.
*   **Pain Point Analysis Agent:**
    *   Name: "PainPoint\_Analyzer"
    *   System Message: "You are skilled at analyzing text data to identify common pain points, frustrations, and unmet needs."
    *   Responsibilities:
        *   Analyze discussions in online communities to identify common pain points.
        *   Categorize pain points and prioritize them based on frequency and severity.
        *   Provide examples of real-world situations where these pain points occur.
*   **Competitor Analysis Agent:**
    *   Name: "Competitor\_Analyzer"
    *   System Message: "You are an expert in analyzing competitor websites and marketing materials to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning."
    *   Responsibilities:
        *   Identify key competitors in the market.
        *   Analyze their websites, marketing materials, and pricing.
        *   Identify their strengths and weaknesses.
        *   Find opportunities to differentiate the consultant's services.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent receives a request from the user (the consultant) to conduct market research.
2.  **Persona Research:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent asks the Persona Research Agent to identify potential target personas.
    *   The Persona Research Agent researches and presents a list of potential personas with descriptions and links to relevant online communities.
3.  **Pain Point Analysis:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent selects a persona and asks the Pain Point Analysis Agent to analyze the discussions in the relevant online communities.
    *   The Pain Point Analysis Agent analyzes the data and presents a list of common pain points, categorized and prioritized.
4.  **Competitor Analysis:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent asks the Competitor Analysis Agent to identify key competitors and analyze their websites and marketing materials.
    *   The Competitor Analysis Agent researches and presents a report on the competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning.
5.  **Synthesis and Reporting:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent reviews the findings from all three agents and synthesizes them into a final report.
    *   The report includes:
        *   A description of the target persona.
        *   A list of their top pain points.
        *   An analysis of the competitive landscape.
        *   Recommendations for how the consultant can position their services to address the identified pain points.
6.  **User Feedback:**
    *   The User Proxy Agent presents the report to the user and solicits feedback.
    *   The user can ask for more information, request additional research, or provide input on the recommendations.
7.  **Iteration:**
    *   The process can be repeated for different target personas or market segments.

**3. Code Structure (Illustrative):**

```python
# Agent Definitions (as in the previous example, but with updated system messages)

# Workflow
def conduct_market_research(user_query):
    # 1. Initialization
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        assistant,
        message=user_query # "Conduct market research for a technical marketing consultant."
    )

    # 2. Persona Research (example)
    persona_research_task = "Identify potential target personas..."
    persona_researcher.initiate_chat(
        user_proxy,
        message=persona_research_task
    )
    persona_results = persona_researcher.last_message()

    # 3. Pain Point Analysis (example)
    painpoint_analysis_task = f"Analyze the discussions in {persona_results} to identify common pain points..."
    painpoint_analyzer.initiate_chat(
        user_proxy,
        message=painpoint_analysis_task
    )
    painpoint_results = painpoint_analyzer.last_message()

    # ... (Continue with Competitor Analysis and Synthesis)

    # Return the final report
    return final_report

# Example Usage
user_query = "Conduct market research for a technical marketing consultant."
report = conduct_market_research(user_query)
print(report)
```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Clear System Messages:** The system messages are crucial for defining the roles and responsibilities of each agent.
*   **Structured Tasks:** Break down the overall goal into smaller, more manageable tasks for each agent.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Define a clear communication protocol between the agents. How will they exchange information? What format will they use?
*   **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where an agent fails to complete its task.
*   **User Interaction:** Design the workflow to allow for user interaction and feedback at key points.
